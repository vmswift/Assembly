# Reboot Command for 16bit 8088 compatible DOS
A simple reboot command for use with old school DOS machines.

Removes the need for pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL and replaces it with the modern feel of entering a simple command.

Program does not instantly reboot and allows many seconds to pass before rebooting via INT 19H.

More information about INT 19H can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call
